    "Using the Python script and job submission script you completed in **Step 1** and **Step 2**, you will need to submit a job to the **IEI Tank-870** edge compute node with hardware such as **Intel® HD Graphics GPU**, **Intel® Movidius™ Neural Compute Stick 2 (NCS2)**, and **Intel® Arria® 10 FPGA**. After the inference is completed, the output video and stats files need to be retrieved and stored in the workspace, which can then be viewed within the Jupyter Notebook.\n",
